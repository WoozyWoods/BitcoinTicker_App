# BitcoinTicker_App
 BitcoinTicker is a simple Cryptocurrency price tracker app. While building this app I learned Dart Loops, Cupertino Widgets and building platform specific UI (iOS & Android). The app uses CoinAPi to get its API data for the values of different coin prices and converts the coin value to a selected currency within the DropdownButton menu.
